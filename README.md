# Topics in Software Engineering

This is a template repository for the topics in software engineering class I teach at CCNY.
It comes with a pre-configured devcontainer that includes most of the tools you'll need during this semester. 
If you start with this repository as a template you will have a ready to go development environment that you'll be able to 
share with your team mates. Additionally, a demo github action workflow has been setup to help you with your first assignment.

# Tools
The tools that are installed with this devcontainer are:

* act which allows you to run GitHub Actions in the local development environment.
* terraform which lets you automate infrastructure provisioning
* aws cli for interacting with AWS environment.

# For Students
If you are a student in the class you can create a new repository using this template. Once you've created a repository of your own replace the content of this file with the description or you project idea.
